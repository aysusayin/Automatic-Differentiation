# Automatic Differentiation
This is the first project of CMPE 250, Data Structures and Algorithms in Fall 2017.

Automatic differentiation is a method for evaluating the rate of change
in the numerical output of a program with respect to the rate of change in
its input.


# How to compile
In a terminal, call commands:

> \>cmake CMakeLists.txt

> \>make

OR

> \>cmake CMakeLists.txt && make

Make sure the executable is produced.

Then you can test the project with the command:

> \>./project4 functionDefinitionFile inputValuesFile outputValuesFile derivativeValuesFile
